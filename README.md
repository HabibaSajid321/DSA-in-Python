# Interval Merging Algorithm

This repository contains an efficient algorithm for merging overlapping intervals within a list of intervals. The provided Python code implements the algorithm and offers a clear explanation of its functionality.

## Problem Statement

Given a list of intervals, where each interval is represented as a pair `[start, end]`, the task is to merge overlapping intervals and return a new list of non-overlapping intervals.

### Example:

```
Input: [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: The intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlap, so they are merged into [1,6].
```

## Solution Overview

The provided Python code offers an efficient solution to the interval merging problem. Here's a breakdown of the solution approach:

1. **Sorting**: The list of intervals is sorted based on the start value of each interval. Sorting is a crucial step for efficiently merging intervals.

2. **Merging**: The algorithm iterates through the sorted list of intervals and merges overlapping intervals. It maintains a `merged` list to store the merged intervals.

3. **Merge Condition**: The algorithm checks if there's an overlap between the current interval and the last merged interval. If there's an overlap, it updates the end value of the last merged interval to the maximum of the current interval's end value and the last merged interval's end value.

4. **Output**: Finally, the algorithm returns the `merged` list containing the merged intervals.

## Usage

To use the provided solution, simply instantiate the `Solution` class and call the `merge` method, passing the list of intervals as an argument.

```python
solution = Solution()
intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
merged_intervals = solution.merge(intervals)
print(merged_intervals)  # Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
```
